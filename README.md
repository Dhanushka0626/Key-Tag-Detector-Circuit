🔑 Key Tag Detector Circuit (Using Consecutive Hand Claps)

📋 Project Overview

   A simple and efficient key tag detector circuit that triggers an audible alert when it detects two consecutive hand claps within a three-second duration. This circuit was developed as part of the EC4050 - 
   Electronic Circuits and Devices course at the University of Jaffna, Faculty of Engineering.

⚙️ Features

  Sound-based detection of misplaced key tags.

  Activates a buzzer upon detecting two claps in three seconds.

  Utilizes three 555 Timer ICs in monostable and astable configurations.

  Low-cost and easy-to-build circuit.

🛠️ Technologies & Components Used

  3 x 555 Timer ICs

  BC547 Transistor

  Capacitors & Resistors

  Microphone

  LEDs

  12V Buzzer

  9V Battery

  Proteus for simulation and PCB design

🔧 Working Principle

   Sound Capture: The microphone detects hand claps.

   Signal Processing: The sound is filtered and processed by two monostable 555 Timer IC circuits and one astable 555 Timer circuit.

   Activation: If two claps are detected within three seconds, the buzzer is activated.
